# 🏦 Simple Banking System

🚀 A hands-on Java project demonstrating exception handling and OOP principles with a minimal banking simulation.

## 🧠 About the Project

This application simulates a basic bank account system where users can perform deposit and withdrawal operations via the console. It showcases the use of custom exceptions (`DomainException`) to enforce business rules such as insufficient balance, while maintaining clean and modular code.

This project was built to strengthen Java skills through the use of object-oriented programming concepts and proper error handling in real-world-like scenarios.

## ✨ Features

✅ **OOP Concepts Applied**:  
- **Encapsulation**: Fields are private with access managed through getters and setters.  
- **Abstraction**: Business logic is isolated within the `BankAccount` class.  
- **Exception Handling**: Custom checked exception (`DomainException`) enforces withdrawal rules.

📋 **Interactive Console Input** using `Scanner`  
🔐 **Validation Rules** using custom exception for business logic enforcement  
📦 **Separation of Concerns**:  
- Entities and exception classes are separated from application logic

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Java 17+ (compatible with Java 8+)
- Standard Java Libraries:
  - `Scanner`
  - `Locale`
  - `System.out`
